# horizontal-scroll-usestate

ðŸŽ‰ this repository is created with CodeSandbox. I am currently working on a project with react nextjs, and I got help from the open source below to implement the function that the screen moves horizontally when the scroll moves vertically. When I looked it up, it is not registered on github, so it is distributed with some modifications.
